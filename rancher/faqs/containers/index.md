## Container FAQs
---

### What are my options with a container?

If you hover over the container, a drop down will appear on the right hand side.

* **Restart:** The container will be restarted.
* **Stop:** The container will be stopped.
* **Start:** This option appears if the container is already stopped. This will start the container again.
* **Delete:** The container will be deleted from the host.
* **View in API:** This will bring up the API for the specific container. If Access Control has been enabled, you will be prompted for a username/password.
* **Execute Shell:** You will be connected to the shell and be able to run commands in the container. Note: If you changed the IP of the host to a private IP, you will no longer be able to access this command. 
* **View Logs:** This will show the docker logs -f on the container.
* **Edit:** In the Edit screen, you have the ability to update some of the settings regarding the container. 

### Why does my container still show up after I have deleted it?

In the background, Rancher is taking care of the necessary steps to remove the container. Upon completion, Rancher UI will automatically refresh and remove the container. 

If you had accidentally deleted your container, you still have an option to save the container from deletion. Using the container’s drop down, you can **Restore** the container and it will stop it from being deleted. Restoring the container will keep it from being deleted, but you will need to **Start** the container to get it running again.

If you want to make the container disappear from your Rancher UI immediately, you can **Purge** the container after deleting it. 

### Why do my deleted containers still show up on the Containers page?

Even if the container is no longer showing on the hosts page, the Container may still show up on the Containers page. Since Rancher needs to spend some time deleting the Container, it will show up on the Container page as _Removed_ until Rancher has finished cleaning it up. If you’d like to have it removed immediately, you can use the drop down menu to **Purge** the container.
