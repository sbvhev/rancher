## Rancher UI
---

After you've [launched Rancher server]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/installing-rancher/installing-server/), the UI will be available at the following URL:

```
http://MANAGEMENT_SERVER_IP:8080
```

Currently, we only support Chrome, Firefox and Safari. 

After you access the URL, we suggest that you configure your [access control]({{site.baseurl}}/configuration/access-control/) so that server and its API is not public. Afterwards, you can follow the UI guides on [adding hosts]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/infrastructure/hosts/) and then [adding services]({{site.baseurl}}/rancher/rancher-ui/applications/stacks/adding-services).
