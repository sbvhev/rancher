## Configuring RancherOS Users
---

Currently, we don't support adding other users besides `rancher`. 

You _can_ add users in the console container, but note that these users will only exist as long as the console container, so it only makes sense in persistent consoles [like ubuntu or debian](/os/configuration/custom-console).
