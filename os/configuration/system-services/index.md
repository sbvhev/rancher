## System Services

_Available as of v0.3.0_

A system service is a container that can be run in either system-docker or user docker. Rancher provides services that are already available in RancherOS by adding them to the [os-services repo](https://github.com/rancher/os-services). Anything in the `index.yml` file from the repo will be an option shown when using the `ros service list` command. This command will list all system services and whether they are enabled or disabled.

You can also create your own system service in the [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) format. Rancher uses `rancher-compose`, which supports almost any key that `docker-compose` supports. The only ones that we don't support are env_file and external_links. The file that creates the system service can either be added directly into RancherOS or hosted at a URL. RancherOS can enable the service from either placement.


### Enabling/Disabling System Services

For any services that are listed from the `ros service list`, they can be enabled by running a single command. In order for the changes take effect, you will also need to reboot. In the future, the reboot will be dynamic.

```bash
$ sudo ros service list
disabled ubuntu-console
disabled debian-console
$ sudo ros service enable ubuntu-console
$ sudo reboot
```

To turn off a system service, run `ros service disable <system-service-name>`. This will only turn off the service, but it will not remove the service from RancherOS. Similar to when we enabled the service, we'll need to reboot in order for the disabling to take effect.

To delete a service that you added, run `ros service delete <system-service-name>`. This will remove the service from the list of services.

### Adding Custom System Services

After creating your own custom service, you can save the rancher compose file in a http(s) url location or within RancherOS. If you choose to save it in RancherOS, the file must be saved in `/var/lib/rancher/conf/` in order for it to be enabled. 

For enabling custom system-services, the command must indicate the file location if saved in RancherOS.

```bash
$ sudo ros service enable /var/lib/rancher/conf/example.yml
```

If the file is saved at a http(s) url, just use the http(s) url when enabling/disabling.

```bash
$ sudo ros service enable http://mydomain.com/example.yml
```

#### Rancher-Compose 

RancherOS uses [rancher-compose](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-compose) to create docker containers. Rancher-Compose is based off of docker-compose and expects the same yaml formats as docker-compose.

**System-Docker vs. User Docker**

RancherOS uses labels to determine if the container should be deployed in system-docker. By default without the label, the container will be deployed in user docker.

```yaml
labels:
  - io.rancher.os.scope=system
```

**Links**

We use [links](https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/#links) to create dependency between containers. In our `ubuntu-console.yml`, we link the container with `cloud-init`, so that the console is able to use `cloud-init`. This also means that the `ubuntu-console` container would start after the `cloud-init` container was started.

```yaml
links:
  - cloud-init
```

Other examples of `links`, which use `network`, to get access to the networking container.

```yaml
links:
  - network
```

**Environment**

With [environment](https://docs.docker.com/compose/yml/#environment) in the yaml file, if the environment is not set (i.e. it doesn't have an `=`), then RancherOS looks up the value in the `rancher.yml` file. 

We support worldwide globbing, so in our example below, the services.yml file will find ETCD_DISCOVERY in the `rancher.yml` file and set the environment to `https://discovery.etcd.io/d1cd18f5ee1c1e2223aed6a1734719f7` for the service. 

`services.yml` File:

```yaml
etcd:
  environment:
    - ETCD_*
```

`rancher.yml` File:

```yaml
rancher:
  environment:
    ETCD_DISCOVERY: https://discovery.etcd.io/d1cd18f5ee1c1e2223aed6a1734719f7
```

**Unsupported Keys in RancherOS**

RancherOS doesn't support some rancher-compose keys as it isn't relevant to RancherOS.

* Build 
* Env_File
* External_Links

If you set the net to your host, then the `hostname` key will not be set for the container. Instead, it will be automatically set to `rancher`.
