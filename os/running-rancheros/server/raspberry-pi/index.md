## Raspberry Pi
---

As of v0.5.0, RancherOS releases include a Raspberry Pi image that can be found on our [releases page](https://github.com/rancher/os/releases). The official Raspberry Pi documentation contains instructions on how to [install operating system images](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/).

When installing, there is no ability to pass in a [cloud-config]({{site.baseurl}}/os/cloud-config). You will need to boot up, change the configuration and then reboot to apply those changes. 

Currently, only Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 are tested and known to work.
